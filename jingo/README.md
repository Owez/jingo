# Jingo CLI

The official CLI for Jingo (code for the `./jingo [file]` program), if you are looking for the main documentation, [go here](../README.md).

This module is not available on crates.io or any other rust repositories, it is just meant to be a self-contained CLI that is build directly from a `git clone` of [the repository](https://github.com/scOwez/jingo/).
